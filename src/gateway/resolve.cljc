  "Turning an `/ipns/{name}` into a CID, with the cache in front of it.

  This is the namespace that moves a deployment off a single naming plane, and
  the shape it takes is **not** a fallback chain. That distinction is the point.

  ## Two planes, discriminated by the name — not ordered by preference

  A `k51…` name is a *key*: holding the Ed25519 private key is the entire
  authority over it, and a record for it is only genuine if it verifies against
  the key the name is derived from. Any other identifier — kotobase.net's graph
  names, a DNSLink label — belongs to whichever plane defines it.

  So the router picks a plane by **what kind of name it is**, and a plane that
  does not own a name never answers for it. Writing this as \"try the DHT, fall
  back to the local registry\" would be a security bug wearing the clothes of a
  reliability feature: a `k51…` name that the DHT cannot answer would fall
  through to a plane that can assert any value it likes for a name whose
  authority is supposed to be a private key nobody else holds. A DHT miss for a
  key-derived name is a **miss**, and the correct answer is 404.

  The legacy plane keeps answering for the names it actually owns, which is
  what makes this a migration rather than a cutover: nothing that resolves
  today stops resolving, and nothing that should be key-authoritative becomes
  registry-authoritative.

  ## The cache is the speed

  Resolution is the expensive step — a DHT round trip, or in kotobase.net's
  case a B2 head GET its own source calls \"the serving floor\" at p50 176ms.
  Everything under a name shares one resolution, so the cache is keyed on the
  name and not the URL, and a stale entry is served while the fresh one is
  fetched rather than making one request per TTL pay the full cost."

(defn lookup
  "Resolve with a cache, returning what to serve *and* what to do next.

  `cache-get` / `cache-put!` are injected — a Cloudflare Worker's `caches`, a
  `js/Map`, a Durable Object, whatever the deployment has.

  The three outcomes are distinguished because a caller must act differently:

  - `:hit` — serve it, do nothing else
  - `:stale` — **serve it now** and refresh in the background. This is the case
    that removes the once-per-TTL latency spike; treating it as a miss puts one
    unlucky request per name per TTL back on the full resolution path
  - `:miss` — resolve before answering

  A resolution that comes back with a *lower* sequence than what is cached is
  rejected: a stale-but-valid record from some peer would otherwise walk the
  name backwards for a whole TTL, which is the failure that makes a gateway
  look like it is losing updates."
