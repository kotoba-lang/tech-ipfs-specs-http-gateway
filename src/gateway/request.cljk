  "Parsing an IPFS HTTP Gateway request (specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways) — the
  path form, the subdomain form, and the query parameters that change what the
  response *is* rather than how it looks.

  Two URL shapes address the same content and they are not interchangeable:

      /ipfs/{cid}/path            path gateway
      {cid}.ipfs.{host}/path      subdomain gateway

  The subdomain form exists for **origin isolation**: two different CIDs served
  from one host share a browser origin, so one page's script can read the
  other's storage and cookies. Moving the CID into the authority makes the
  browser treat them as different sites. A gateway that serves only the path
  form is not merely less convenient — it cannot safely host untrusted content.

  ## The case trap

  DNS labels are case-insensitive. A CIDv0 (`Qm…`) and a base58 CIDv1 are
  **case-sensitive**, so they cannot be a subdomain label at all: `QmFoo.ipfs.…`
  and `qmfoo.ipfs.…` are the same host to DNS and different CIDs to IPFS. The
  spec's answer is a redirect to the base32 form, which is lowercase by
  construction. A gateway that skips the redirect appears to work — until a
  resolver or proxy normalizes the case and the request starts resolving to a
  different CID, or to nothing.

  `parse` reports this as `:redirect` rather than an error, because it *is* the
  correct handling and the caller should emit a 301."

(def response-formats
  "`?format=` and its `Accept` equivalent (specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway).

  These change what the body *is*, not how it is presented:

  - `raw` — the single block's bytes, verifiable by hashing them
  - `car` — a CAR stream of the blocks, verifiable the same way
  - `dag-json` / `dag-cbor` — the IPLD node, re-encoded

  Absent, the gateway *deserializes*: it walks UnixFS and returns a file, which
  the client cannot verify. That difference is the whole meaning of \"trustless
  gateway\", and defaulting to the deserialized form is right for browsers and
  wrong for anything that intends to check what it got."
